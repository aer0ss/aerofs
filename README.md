AeroFS
---

This repository holds the source code for
 - AeroFS Private Cloud appliance
 - AeroFS desktop client (Linux, macOS, Windows)


The code on this branch (`eol`) is as-is, as of the last maintenance release
of AeroFS Private Cloud in 2018, with the following additions:

 - [Letter from the acting CEO](AeroFS_Open_Source.pdf) authorizing the Open Source release
 - [LICENSE](LICENSE) file to reflect the release under MIT license


This branch will *not* build as-is. It is intended to remain frozen as an
archaelogical artifact. 7 years is a very long time in the tech world,
and many of the relevant tools have evolved in incompatible ways, or gone
unmaintained, not to mention all the bits of internal infrastructure tied
to AeroFS the company, which have long been turned off...

Work to bring the codebase back to a buildable/usable state will proceed in
the `main` branch.
