    <h4>What is Team Server?</h4>
    <p>
        AeroFS Team Server is an software application that securely backs
        up your entire organization's files at a central location, either on your local drive or
        Amazon S3. It provides a central access point for your organization's data.
        ## TOOD (WW) this should points to the public Web site rather than a marketing page
        ## inside the private deployment. Add a static path that points to the public Web
        ## site.

    <h4>How to add users to sync?</h4>
    <p>
        Once installed, the server will immediately sync with your own AeroFS clients.
        To sync with colleagues and clients, simply
        <a href="${request.route_path('org_users')}">invite them to your organization</a>.
        After they accept the invitation, all their AeroFS files will be synced
        to the Team Server.

    <h4>What if I install multiple Team Servers?</h4>
    <p>
        Multiple servers installed under the same account will automatically
        replicate data amongst each other, whether they are in an office LAN or over
        the Internet.
