/**
This package contains general exceptions used by AeroFS as well as their base and helper classes.
All of these exceptions have their corresponding type in PBException, and therefore inherits
AbstractExWirable.

Exceptions specific to subsystems (e.g. Core, SP) should be defined in the subsystems' packages.

TODO move subsystem-specific exceptions from this package.
