/**
 * {@link CoreProgressWatcher} periodically checks whether the daemon is making progress. The main
 * check revolves around {@link CoreEventDispatcher}. However some events operate on large object
 * hierarchies in ways that do not allow them to release the core lock and may thus take longer than
 * the interval between two successive progress checks.
 *
 * To remedy to that situation we need alternate ways for long running events to indicate that they
 * are making progress, however slowly.
 *
 * The first approach is to use a monotonic progress counter, incremented after each item of a
 * potentially large collection is processed. This is mostly used in {@link DirectoryService#walk_}
 * and recursive file I/O operations.
 *
 * Unfortunately, some long running tasks do not necessarily provide feedback on their progress. For
 * instance copying a large file accross file systems, or shelling out to an external program may
 * span more than on progress check interval. To work around this we use a second counter, which we
 * dub the "in-progress syscall" counter. It is incremented/decremented around potentially long
 * running tasks and CoreProgressWatcher will not kill a daemon when this counter is non-zero.
 *
 * NB: This is one of the situations where the lack of scoping semantics in Java is annoying because
 * it makes it harder to transparently enforce decrements so y'all better be damn careful when using
 * this counter
 *
 * NB: This class is part of the lib module to make sure it can be used directly in {@link FileUtil}
 * and similar locations but ideally it should belong in the daemon module...
