# Generating Binaries

This step must be done separately on each platform (OSX, Linux32, Linux64,
Windows). OSX and Linux binaries can be built on OSX. Windows support is not yet implemented.

## OSX

Run `make osx` to build.

## Linux32

Run `make linux32` to build.

## Linux64

Run `make linux64` to build.
