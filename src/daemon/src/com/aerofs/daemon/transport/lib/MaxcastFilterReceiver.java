/**
 * MaxcastFilterReceiver
 * @author markj
 * With MaxcastFilterSender, this pair of classes assigns a unique maxcast ID
 * to each maxcast packet that is sent over multiple transports in NSL.
 * Duplicate/redundant packets will inevitably be received by each peer for
 * each network interface/transport. Thus, upon receiving a maxcast payload
 * packet, each transport must check whether that particular mcast ID has
 * already been received from the given device ID. The method "isReundant"
 * below provides this functionality by storing <DID, int> pairs in a private
 * map, and checking if the pair already exists.
 *
 * Shortcomings:
 * - Mcast IDs are packaged into the EOMaxcastMessage class, so we do not filter
 *   packets sent over many unicasts (see NSL layer).
 * - In "isRedundant" we only check for equality of mcast ID's, so if packets
 *   arrive out of order, they will not be filtered away. This is not incorrect,
 *   it simply results in occasionally unfiltered packets.
