     * On case-insensitive filesystems there are numerous opportunities for race conditions
     * to break typical consistency expectations. When applying changes from logical filesystem
     * to physical filesystem it is necessary to to check that the file on which the change
     * is about to be applied has not changed.
     *
     * For instance, if a user creates two files 'foo' and 'FOO' only one will be visible
     * on a case-insensitive system, say 'foo'. Now if the user delete that visible file 'foo'
     * and immediately create a new file 'FOO' the existing 'FOO' will be renamed to 'FOO (2)'.
     *
     * So far so good. Now imagine the client receives an update form the network asking to
     * delete the original 'foo' while it is still in the TimeoutDeletionBuffer.
     *
     * If FID consistency is not checked before acting upon the deletion this will have the
     * unintended result of deleting 'FOO'. Similar issues can arise with moves.
     *
     * Throwing will prevent the remote logical operation from being applied until the core
     * DB catches up with local physical changes.
     *
     * @throws InconsistentFIDException if DB and FS FID do not match
