# SafetyNet: Avoiding Reinstall Situations Early
#
#####################################################

Introduction
============
SafetyNet is an extra step in the build/deploy process. It runs right after AeroFS is built,
packaged and uploaded to the release server. SafetyNet is meant to simulate a production
release by having company-controlled AeroFS clients receive a production update, and then
run selected tests to ensure everything is working correctly. If the tests pass,
the deploy process continues with the publishing of the AeroFS client binaries to
the production S3 bucket, available to all users.

Terms
========
- AeroFS release candidate (ARC): The AeroFS release version that has been built, packaged
                                  and is ready to be deployed and tested by SafetyNet.
- SafetyNet client (SN): An AeroFS installation on a machine that will receive an update from
                         the SafetyNet S3 bucket and be subjected to SafetyNet tests.

Requirements
============
- The AeroFS client binaries, packages and update methods must be identical to that of
  a real production user's setup.
- The AeroFS client must communicate with production servers.
- The updater must be tested. This includes testing whether or not a subsequent update
  will succeed.
- The following platforms must be tested: OSX Snow Leopard, OSX Mountain Lion, Windows XP,
  Windows 7, Ubuntu 32-bit, Ubuntu 64-bit.
- SafetyNet must pass before a full deployment to production can occur.

Architecture
============
The goal of SafetyNet is to simulate an average user's AeroFS environment. In that regard, the AeroFS client binaries
being tested should be identical to the binaries a user would install. Because of this requirement, the method in which
the SafetyNet clients receive updates must not touch any AeroFS code or packaging.

|------| <--------------------------- |------------| <----------------------------------- |-----------|


In that regard, an AeroFS release candidate (ARC) will check for updates and download them from an S3 bucket, much like
the production client. The difference is that a custom DNS service will give the SafetyNet client an IP address which points to
a special SafetyNet S3 bucket, where the ARC binaries are hosted. Due to certificate issues using HTTPS, a man-in-the-middle
attack is performed on the SafetyNet clients so they believe they are getting the updates from a trusted source.

At the time of writing, the SafetyNet clients each run in their own VM, hosted on one machine.

Implementation
==============
SafetyNet is implemented using a series of SyncDET tests to carry out actions and test for invariants on the remote
SafetyNet systems. A configuration file tells SyncDET where each machine is located (IP address), along with their
login usernames and other important details.

The command server, along with Verkehr, are used to notify the SafetyNet clients that an update is ready to download.
This feature is included in the production release of AeroFS and simply serves to minimize the time spent waiting for
a client to update automatically. The email addresses of the users to notify are extracted from the configuration file
mentioned above.

The following is a tree representation of the SafetyNet directory:

                                        # for an updated controller_address field.

The main script 'safetynet' is called from the build process' 'exec_prepublish_checks' script.
The steps in the process are as follows:

1) Push the ARC binaries to the SafetyNet S3 bucket
2) Check that each SafetyNet client's version is less than the ARC version, or the clients won't update
3) Backup each SafetyNet client's installation (approot and rtroot)
4) Launch any AeroFS instance that is not already running
5) Use the command server to tell the SafetyNet clients to update
6) Wait for the version file on each client to change to the ARC version number
7) Check for the existence of the AeroFS GUI process and ping the daemon
8) Decrease the version numbers on each SafetyNet client
9) Repeat steps 4, 5, 6, and 7
10) Success!

Usage
=====
Building and deploying production should happen as usual. SafetyNet is executed automatically.
$ ant deploy -Dmode=PUBLIC

Troubleshooting
===============
If anything goes wrong with the SafetyNet test that isn't directly related to a bug in the AeroFS client, a few
steps can be taken to resolve the issue.

To run the SafetyNet step alone (assuming an ARC package is already built and uploaded to the release server), execute:
$ tools/build/bootstrap safetynet/safetynet RELEASE_VERSION

NOTE: SafetyNet always runs assuming the MODE is PUBLIC.

The 'tools/build/bootstrap' script simply sets up required paths and helper functions to help with Bash scripting. It is used to launch all scripts
in the tools/build directory.

If the clients already updated, but need to be rolled back due to a problem in the ARC, execute:
$ tools/build/bootstrap safetynet/rollback_clients

If something else went wrong and the clients updated but you want them to update again (without necessarily reverting anything), you can
make them think they need to update by decreasing their local version numbers:
$ tools/build/bootstrap safetynet/decrease_versions

Caveats
========
- Windows Vista and up don't allow launching a GUI application from a Windows service (including sshd, via which SyncDET operates). A separate
  server needs to be launched on the Windows SafetyNet machine from the GUI (not through ssh). The server is located in the deploy directory,
  under tools.
- If the rt_root gets large, or the SafetyNet machines slow down, backing up and rolling back may take a long time. The timeouts for those
  actions are 5 minutes each, but time is a fickle mistress.
- The full Windows installer requires UAC privileges to install. UAC must be disabled on the SafetyNet test machine.
- Support for an OSX SafetyNet client is temporarily not available as there are issues with our custom DNS solution for that platform.

Future Improvements
===================
- Much work can be done on SyncDET to better support Windows. Perhaps a SyncDET daemon running on each actor
  would help solve the many issues faced with running GUI applications from within the sshd process tree.
- Support passing arguments to SyncDET tests.
- Build a ritual like API for the GUI, or effectively create CLI processes for all platforms.
- Include 'silent' options for everything to help automate processes like installation.
- Include SafetyNet with CI so that the deployment process is simply a matter of pushing binaries that have passed to S3.
