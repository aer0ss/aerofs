Managing shared folders of team members
---------------------------------------

(Please read sharing_and_migration.txt first to understand basic mechanisms of sharing.)

(Note that all the following features are under development.)

* Team admins can list folders shared with team members, and see external collaborators 
  on these folders, regardless of the privilege and status of the members on the folders.
* The privilege of team admins on a shared folder is identical to the highest privilege 
  team members has on the folder. For example, if all the team members on a folder are
  non-owners, admins cannot manage the folder, either. The admin can manage the folder
  (e.g. invite and remove users and destroy the folder).

The above mechanism has a potential security issue: If a member shares an folder internal 
to the company and then transfers ownership to an external user immediately after, the
admin will lose the ability to control that folder. This is the issue with box.com as 
well.

In the future, we can allow admins to block users from sharing files with external 
users or to limit sharing to specific domains.

Team migration
--------------

When a user is invited to another team:

* If the user is a non-admin of another team, he can accept and join the team. Durign joining,
  The ACL of all the folders shared with the user will remain unchanged. (Should the admin
  of the current team approve first?)
* If the user is an admin of another team with a single member, he can accept the invite.
  The team's information (team server user info, etc) will be completely deleted from the
  database.
* If the user is a sole admin of another team with multiple members, he is not allowed to
  accept the invite until he assigns more admins or removes all other members.
