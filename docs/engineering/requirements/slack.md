Let's make a Slack behind the firewall.

## 3 Slack Functions

- Communication: lightweight 1:1 and group real-time messaging.
- Archival: store any content (messages, files, links) forever. 
- Search: easy and powerful search.

A few things that are standing out:
- API integration: automated messages, apps that can be executed in place (spotify).
- code snippets and posts.
- read-state synchronization: if a message is read on a mobile device it shows as read on the other devices.
- search with context: results are expandable and collapsable on their original conversation, which makes information retrieval much faster.
- search includes all documents, even psd, commit messages.
