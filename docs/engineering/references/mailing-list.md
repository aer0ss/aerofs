New team employees are automatically added to team@aerofs.com group email list. [Here](https://groups.google.com/a/aerofs.com/forum/#!forumsearch/) is the list of other groups that have been created, which are opt-in based on your needs and interests.

General guidelines:

  * Remember that new employees can't search archives sent to team@aerofs.com.  So send things to other mailing lists for archival purposes.
    * This also applies when using email as logging infrastructure.
  * Subscribe to lists that interest you.
  * CC lists relevant to your discussion.
