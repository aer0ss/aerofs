\section*{Collaborative version history}
Whenever a remote file update is downloaded (including modifications and
deletions), the local copy of the file is saved to a special location,
creating a local version history for every file. Through a GUI display, users
can restore files from this version history. The version history is
truncated after some time period.

One can also consider the global version history for a file in the
distributed system of devices, which includes these local saves across all
devices. In another embodiment, each version history file is tagged with its
corresponding version vector, and the user id and device id which instigated the
update. Users can visualize the system aggregate version history tree, and if a
desired file version is not locally present, the device can request that version
from the device that performed the backup. When requesting remote version
history, the local device can avoid presenting duplicate version history items
by detecting duplicate version vectors.
