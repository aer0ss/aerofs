\section*{Team Server: Multiple User Accounts on One Device}

For a team of users who wish to use a shared device to back up their files,
the system provides a Team Server type account which permits multiple stores
from multiple users on the same device. This Team Server account would be
among those in the Access Control Lists (ACLs) for all stores shared by the team
members, including the root store for all team member users. The Team Server
account is concerned with stores, and thus need only synchronize one copy of a
store as it is shared by multiple users. Whereas the support of file migration
across stores for a single-user device necessitates the invariant that an object
id can be admitted in only one store on a device, on a Team Server, an object id
may be admitted in multiple stores, because Team Servers are not concerned with
migration.

One source of backup is often insufficient, thus the system offers a
self-replicating server farm, via multiple Team Servers. In one embodiment,
one Team Server account is installed on $n$ devices, and the algorithms of this
patent and the base system~\cite{wang:patent2012} synchronize the files and
folders of those servers, providing a replication factor of $n$. In another
embodiment, multiple devices are installed with the same account, but each
device stores a partition of the total team space requirements, permitting a
scalable replication factor from 1 to n. This is achieved atop the Selective
Sync algorithm, by setting the "expelled" flag on some devices.
