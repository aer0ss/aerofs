 abstract = {A system and method for cloud file management are disclosed.
According to one embodiment, a computer-implemented method comprises registering
the first user and the first device with a server, creating a library for object
storage, transmitting an invitation to access the library to a second user, the
second user having a second device, verifying and granting the second user
access to the library, wherein granting the second user access to the library
comprises granting the second device access to the library. An object having a
replication factor and two or more components is stored on one or more of the
first device and the second device according to the replication factor and total
storage available on the first device and the second device.}
