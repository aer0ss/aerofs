SWAGGER, and how to live with it.

---- Generating swagger specs ----

Swagger may be good or bad, depending how you use it. As long as your documentation
comes _from_ your code, and you don't count on an omniscient being to somehow update
them in lockstep, you're doing it right!

Three ways to work with Swagger.

1.) (Best). Virtually all of our server stacks have good support for some
    swagger-core plugin. Swagger will read the annotations on your real code,
    and generate a simple configuration-file specification of your entire web API.

    You can download the swagger spec from your server, commit it in this folder,
    and then disable the swagger listener in production use; for example:

        curl -k -v https://share.syncfs.com/messaging/swagger.yaml > trifrost.yaml

2.) (Also good). Use a swagger editor (try http://editor.swagger.io !) to build
    the swagger spec directly, and see the documentation as you work on the spec.

    When you want reviewers, download the swagger spec and commit it here. Send
    your review team to look at
        docs.arrowfs.org:8000/engineering/apidocs/
    or if you think they're lazy,
        docs.arrowfs.org:8000/swagger-ui/dist?url=/engineering/apidocs/my_new_service.yaml

    When you're done with reviews, ask swagger to generate a server package.

    Then, and this is IMPORTANT, throw out the hand-built spec. From now on,
    your server code *is* the spec. Use mode (1) to extract the spec, commit it here.

3.) (Bad). Use a swagger editor. When you change the spec, update the code to
    match. This is not recommended. Don't do it. They will never be kept in sync.

---- Building an index for the docs server ----

The swagger-ui piece is a delightfully simple chunk of static web resources
that gives you a live view of API documentation. It includes the ability to
run commands directly against your server (if it is configured and accessible).

A script on the docs server will generate an index.html for a set of swagger specs
in this directory, and expose them using swagger-ui:

    http://docs.arrowfs.org:8000/swagger-ui/dist?url=/engineering/apidocs/YOUR_WHATEVER.json
