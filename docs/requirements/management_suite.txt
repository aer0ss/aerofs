Management Suite Requirements
================================================

This doc summarizes our initial draft of the requirements for an AeroFS
Management Suite. The intended users of this app are IT Admins.

3 main components (which are elaborated below)
---------------------------------------------------
1) User management (e.g. add/rm)
2) Settings configuration (e.g. S3, enable global sharing)
3) "Home Page": some summary of analytics (for later)

1) User management
- three user authorization levels:
  i)   User (cannot add or remove Users)
  ii)  Admin (adds or removes Users)
  iii) Super-Admin (adds or removes Admins)
  iv)  ?? (keep this list flexible)
- tasks
  o add/remove users
  o convert users into admins (otherwise who has the rights to add users)
  o reset passwords (non-trivial but very important)
  o ban devices (not for first revision)

2) Settings configuration
These settings are initialized at installation time, but could change
later, so a panel must be available in the Mgt Suite.
- company-wide cloud backup
  i)   enable
  ii)  disable
  iii) opt-in: disable by default, users can individually opt-in
- specify backup provider (S3 for now, but permit others later?)
- specify S3 credentials
- specify own S3 bucket
- globally enable/disable sharing outside the company domain
- centralized configuration of services provided by deployment VMs

3) "Home Page" (all optional right now)
- view of backup space currently used (globally or per user)
- view network traffic?


Miscellaneous
---------------------------------------------------
Licensing:
- restrict number of users
- enforce payment
- if periodic payment ends, do something inconvenient (stopping sync is hard)
- this could be done later if Management Suite is offered for free at first

Installation: collaborate with Matt

Updating:
- should be easy to update Mgt Suite: e.g. apt-get update hook
- must be able to update KVMs for security patches etc.
  o diff?
  o re-install?
