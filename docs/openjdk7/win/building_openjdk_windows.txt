Building OpenJDK 7 on Windows
=============================

Note (greg): this is an old document that I wrote explaining the steps to make a Windows XP build machine.


The information below is based on the following helpful resources:

- http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7/build/raw-file/tip/README-builds.html
- http://stas-blogspot.blogspot.com/2012/09/building-openjdk-on-windows.html
- https://github.com/alexkasko/openjdk-unofficial-builds/blob/master/README.md

1. Set up a clean, fully patched Windows XP VM
	Fresh Windows XP VM
	Updated
	Installed Google Chrome
	Installed Visual Studio 2010

2. Install Cygwin. Make sure the following packages are installed: (they aren't by default)
	binutils, make, m4, cpio, awk, file, zip, unzip, procps

3. Update make. The make version that ships with Cygwin doesn't work because it doesn't handle the paths properly.
    - Rename C:\cygwin\bin\make.exe to make_cygwin.exe
	- Download make.exe from http://www.cmake.org/files/cygwin/make.exe and put it in C:\cygwin\bin
	- Copy C:\cygwin\bin\cygintl-8.dll to C:\cygwin\bin\cygintl-3.dll

4. Install DirectX SDK. OpenJDK recommends using a very old version, but that caused some problems. I ended up using the latest SDK recommended by Microsoft (DirectX SDK June 2010)

5. Install a Java 6 JDK to serve as a bootstrap JDK. I used Oracle's JDK 6u43. Make sure to install it in a path with NO SPACES

6. Install Apache Ant and make sure it's in the path. No spaces in the path!

Note: In environment variables, make sure all paths use forward slashes, exept for the PATH variable itself.

7. Download and build Freetype:
	1. Download FreeType v.2.4.7 from http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freetype/
	2. Unpack it somewhere and open '\builds\win32\vc2010\freetype.sln' in Visual Studio.
	3. Click on Build -> Configuration Manager and make sure "Release Multithreaded" is selected
	4. Goto the project properties (right click on "freetype" in project tree) and in 'Configuration Properties / General':
		- Target name: 'freetype'
		- Target extension: '.dll'
		- Configuration type: 'Dynamic Library (.dll)'
	5. Update ftoption.h, add following two lines:
		#define FT_EXPORT(x) __declspec(dllexport) x
		#define FT_BASE(x) __declspec(dllexport) x
	6. Make a build and you will get dll & lib in 'objs\win32\vc2010'.
	7. Do not forget to assign appropriate values to 'ALT_FREETYPE_LIB_PATH' and 'ALT_FREETYPE_HEADERS_PATH' variables. Use forward slashes.

8. Checkout the OpenJDK7u sources in OS X. Follow instructions in the build readme. Basically:

	hg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7/jdk7 YourOpenJDK
	cd YourOpenJDK
	sh ./get_source.sh

	Pick the version that you want to check out. I used the latest release, 7u14 build 15:

	sh ./make/scripts/hgforest.sh pull -u
	sh ./make/scripts/hgforest.sh checkout jdk7u14-b15

	(OpenJDK is made of several sub-repositories. You need to use the make/scripts/hgforest.sh script to apply the same mercurial command to all of them.)

9. Share the openjdk sources folder with your Windows XP VM

10. Make sure the following environment variables are set. (Use an env var editor such as RapidEE.exe, much more practical than the default Windows interface)
	ALT_BOOTDIR=C:/path/to/jdk6
	ANT_HOME=C:/path/to/ant

11. Had to add OPENJDK=true at the top of hotspot/make/windows/makefiles/generated.make

12. Launch a Cygwin terminal.
	$ cd /path/to/openjdk
	$ sh ./make/scripts/vsvars.sh -v10 > settings && eval `cat settings`
	$ make ARCH_DATA_MODEL=32 ALT_FREETYPE_LIB_PATH=C:/path/to/freetype-2.4.7/objs/win32/vc2010 ALT_FREETYPE_HEADERS_PATH=C:/path/to/freetype-2.4.7/include UNLIMITED_CRYPTO=true FULL_DEBUG_SYMBOLS=0 HOTSPOT_BUILD_JOBS=4 PARALLEL_COMPILE_JOBS=4


===================================

Post build

## For some reason all files have the executable bit set. Fix this:

$ cd build/j2sdk-image
$ find . -type f -print | xargs chmod -x
$ find . -iname "*.exe" | xargs chmod +x
$ find . -iname "*.dll" | xargs chmod +x
