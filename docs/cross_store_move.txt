when creating meta for file o in store s:
----

if (o.origin is not set || origin store doesn't exist || o.oid is offline in the origin store) {
	create o in s;
	return
}

copy all branches and their associated versions, including KML, from the origin store to s

move o in the origin to trash, without incrementing the version

set knowledge of s to the minimum of both origin and s

download meta of o in the origin as soon as possible, using downloadAsync
