# AeroFS Professional Services

This document outlines our professional services offering.

## Overview

We are a product company, not a services company. We are focused on building a
great product, with a great customer success team to support that product.

## Bridges vs. Buildings

Our professional services mentality is as follows: we will build bridges, but
we will seldom design and construct new buildings on a per-customer basis.

Helping our customers integrate the AeroFS Private Cloud (and our other
products) into their systems is valuable for all of us. This is bridge
building, and we will happily engage and participate in this activity.

Constructing new buildings on a per-customer basis is not our expertise; we
would rather help build out our existing products to meet the needs of the
customer, if it makes sense in the context of the engineering roadmap.

## Marketing

Our professional services are currently not advertised, but are discussed on a
case-by-case basis during the sales process. This underlines our mentality and
message: we are a product company.

## Pricing

TBD/evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
