# Customer Success: Getting Started

First off, welcome to the team!

You are joining a team of passionate, customer-driven technical professionals,
who are focused on building amazing experiences for every customer on our
platform. We hope you're as excited to get started as we are to have you with
us.

## 0. Administrative

Talk to ops about getting all your docs sorted out, including NDA, offer
letter, payroll, etc.

## 1. Creds

Get access to the following systems:

* GMail
* Zendesk
* JIRA
* Bonusly
* Slack
* Gerrit
* Github

And maybe others...

## 2. Docs

Review our [organization docs](http://docs.arrowfs.org:8000/customer-success/organization/).
They outline the facets of the customer success team as well as our high level
goals.

## 3. Platform Overview

Next, dive into our product! This will be your first step toward being a
platform expert. After Matt has given you a high-level arch overview, take some
time to research and experiment with every aspect of the product you can think
of and discover. This should take a couple days.

*Definitely ask questions throughout -- your team is here to help*.

At the end of the exercise, we'll review your experience to:

* Answer any remaining questions.
* File tickets for bugs.
* File tickets for product improvements (I'm sure you'll find plenty of things
  that we can do better -- a new perspective here is always great!).
* File tickets for doc improvements (our docs live on support.aerofs.com).

Here are some areas to focus on:

* Licensing web interface (privatecloud.aerofs.com)
* Web (end-user and administrative)
* Desktop client (win, linux, mac)
* Group sharing feature (web, desktop).
* Team Server (win, linux, mac)
* Mobile (iOS and Android)
* Device restriction subsystem (recommendation: write a program to define
  different rules to test out this subsystem).
* Auditing interface (try splunk integration).
* Service status interface (recommendation: test the command line interface).
* Backup and upgrade server flow (recommendation: perform an actual upgrade,
  and watch the desktop client auto-update).
* ActiveDirectory integration (recommendation: try out OpenDS, and integrate
  it with your appliance).

## 4. Ramp up in support

Next step, dive into support. Being on the front-line with customers is the
best way to learn about their pain-points, and continue to expand your product
knowledge. Every customer success team member should spend their first couple
weeks in support, after they've ramped up on product.

## 5. The Future

Talk to Matt to figure out what's next for you!
