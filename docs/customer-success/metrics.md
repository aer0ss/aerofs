# Customer Success Metrics

## Overview

At a high level, "customer success", as a metric, is an aggregate of:

* Usage (patterns, user counts)
* Engagement
    * Support
        * Engagement
        * Satisfaction
        * Product Health (e.g. bug ratios)
    * CSE engagement
    * Sales engagement

Each of these items factors into the overall customer health number.

## Tools

Currently these items are not automatically aggregated in any way. In the
future, we might choose to look into one of these customer success tools to
accomplish this:

* Gainsight
* Bluenose
* Totango
* Silota
* FrontLeaf
