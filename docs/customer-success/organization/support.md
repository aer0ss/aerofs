# AeroFS Support Team

This document outlines our support team's responsibilities.

## Overview

The support team is responsible for reactively addressing customer issues and
questions.

The meta responsibility of support is to <strong>kill support</strong>.
Ideally, our customers should never need to reach out to us with questions or
bugs. The support team should drive product improvement, bug fixes, and
self-serve documentation creation to make the AeroFS experience as smooth as
possible.

## Documentation

As a corollary to the above, the support team is also responsible for
maintaining our help center documentation.
