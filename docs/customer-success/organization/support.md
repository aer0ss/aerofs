# AeroFS Support Team

This document outlines our support team's responsibilities.

## Overview

The support team is responsible for reactively addressing customer issues and
questions.

### Policy: Unix Philosophy

We provide the same level of support to all of the people that are using our
product, regardless of payment tiers. We do this for a couple reasons:

* Unix Philosophy: providing the same level of service to everyone reduces
  distraction, and allows us to do one thing well: provide an exceptional
  customer service experience.
* Free users drive product improvement too! All interactions help us improve
  our product quality.
* Marketing: what people say matters. Even free users.

## Meta

The meta responsibility of support is to <strong>kill support</strong>.
Ideally, our customers should never need to reach out to us with questions or
bugs. The support team should drive product improvement, bug fixes, and
self-serve documentation creation to make the AeroFS experience as smooth as
possible.

## Success

Customer success is measured by customer satisfaction and product improvements
initiatives that originate in support.

### Training and Documentation

As a corollary to the above, the support team is also responsible for
maintaining our help center documentation.

This responsibility is shared with the implementation group.
