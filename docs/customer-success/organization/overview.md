# AeroFS Customer Success: Organization Overview

## Goal

The goal of the customer success organization is as follows: <strong>to ensure
our customers are successful in using the AeroFS platform</strong>.

## Execution

To accomplish this goal, we break down team team into the following areas:

* <strong>[Implementation](./implementation.html)</strong>
* <strong>[Support](./support.html)</strong>
* <strong>[Solutions](./solutions.html)</strong>

Regardless of sub-team, team members should always consider the overall goal of
the organization, and should always strive to look for ways to improve our
value-add to our customers.

## Naming

In the past, this organization might have been referred to as "services". We
prefer the more modern "customer success" terminology, because it better
reflects our goal as opposed to our execution.

## Team Profile

As defined in our [hiring guide](../hiring/customer-success-engineer.html), our
team is composed of individuals that is are a mix of software engineer, product
manager, sales person and support person. Because of the nature of our product
and our execution path to achieve customer success, our CS team is much more
technical than the industry standard, i.e. the baseline technical knowledge
required is very high.
