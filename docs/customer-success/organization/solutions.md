# AeroFS Solutions Team

This document outlines our solutions team's responsibilities.

## Overview

### Preface

We are a product company, not a services company. We are focused on building a
great product, with a great customer success team to support that product.

### Policy: Bridges vs. Buildings

Our professional services mentality is as follows: we will build bridges, but
we will seldom design and construct new buildings on a per-customer basis.
Helping our customers integrate the AeroFS Private Cloud (and our other
products) into their systems is valuable for all of us. This is bridge
building, and we will happily engage and participate in this activity.

### Marketing

Our professional services are currently not advertised, but are discussed on a
case-by-case basis during the sales process. This underlines our
product-oriented culture.

### Pricing

TBD/evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Medium to high market rate (depending
on the value-add to our organization). SOW required.

## Meta

To prevent parallel engineering organizations, the solutions team resources
will be pooled with engineering. This allows the engineers to stay close to the
core team, while still being customer facing.

Solutions engineers might spend time automating other aspects of our internal
operations in order to serve our customers better (e.g. helpdesk system
improvements, etc.).

## Success

Success is measured based on the revenue valud-add to the organization.
