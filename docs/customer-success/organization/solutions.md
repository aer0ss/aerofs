# AeroFS Solutions Team

This document outlines our solutions team's responsibilities.

## Overview

### Policy: Bridges vs. Buildings

Our professional services mentality is as follows: we will build bridges, but
we will seldom design and construct new buildings on a per-customer basis.
Helping our customers integrate the AeroFS Private Cloud (and our other
products) into their systems is valuable for all of us. This is bridge
building, and we will happily engage and participate in this activity.

### Marketing

Our professional services are currently not advertised, but are discussed on a
case-by-case basis during the sales process.

### Pricing

TBD and evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Medium to high market rate
(depending on the value-add to our organization). SOW required.

## Meta

To prevent parallel engineering organizations, the solutions team resources
will be pooled with engineering. This allows the engineers to stay close to the
core team, while still being customer facing.

## Success

Success is measured based on the revenue valud-add to the organization.
