# AeroFS Solutions Team

This document outlines our professional services offering (i.e. our solutions
team).

## Preface

We are a product company, not a services company. We are focused on building a
great product, with a great customer success team to support that product.

## Policy: Bridges vs. Buildings

Our professional services mentality is as follows: we will build bridges, but
we will seldom design and construct new buildings on a per-customer basis.
Helping our customers integrate the AeroFS Private Cloud (and our other
products) into their systems is valuable for all of us. This is bridge
building, and we will happily engage and participate in this activity.

## Marketing

Our professional services are currently not advertised, but are discussed on a
case-by-case basis during the sales process. This underlines our mentality and
message: we are a product company.

## Pricing

TBD/evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Medium to high market rate (depending
on the value-add to our organization); SOW required.
