# AeroFS Implementation Team

This document outlines our implementation team's responsibilities.

## Overview

The implementation engineer is the technical point of contact for the large
enterprise customer. When an opportunity is <strong>qualified</strong>, the
prospect is assigned an implementation engineer. This is part of the onboarding
process. Just as all qualified opportunities have a sales contact, they have
an implementation contact as well.

It is the implementation engineer's reponsibility to work with the customer to
deploy and scale the solution, as well as liason with other technical
departments (support, solutions, engineering, product) when necessary. The
implementation engineer remains the primary technical point of contact
throughout the customer lifecycle.

## Meta

The meta responsibility of the implementation engineering is to <strong>reduce
touches</strong>. We should strive to make our onboarding as self-servicable
as possible.

## Success

Implementation in this context doesn't just mean the server is deployed and
running; it is also the responsibility of the implementation engineer to do
whatever it takes to ensure customer success, i.e. adoption and value-add,
within the organization. The implementation engineer has the resources
(usage data, other metrics, and technical skills) needed to dive deep into a
customer's specific issues, and is responsible for diagnosing and fixing those
issues in a proactive manner in collaboration with the sales team to foster
upsell and renewal.

## Other

### Training and documentation

As a corollary of the above, the implementation engineer is also responsible
for training the IT adminisrator and other individuals within the customer's
organization.

This responsibility is shared with the support group.
