External Properties README
--------------------------

The set of "external properties" provided in the external.properties file in
this directory can be described as key value pairs that are used to render the
resulting set of "configuration properties". See the design document for
details.

Comments are not supported in the external.properties file, nor should the file
be edited manually, since it is managed by the configuration service. You can
add comments about specific external property key value pairs in this file.
