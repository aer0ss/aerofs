In /opt/ca (this directory) run ./deploy <ca_files_directory> where
the ca_files_directory is usually just "prod".

This will create a new directory named "prod" which contains some
openssl related things. You will be prompted to create a ca cert password.

Then export capass=<whatever_password_you_specified> and run ./ca.py (be sure to
delete your bash history for security purposes).

Then run /opt/ca/ca.py <ca_files_directory>

That's it, enjoy!
