In /opt/ca (this directory) run ./deploy.sh (this creates the new CA root
certificate in a new directory named "prod"). You will be prompted to create a
CA cert password.

To start the CA, execute the following commands:

screen
read -s capass
<enter your ca certificate password>
export capass
/opt/ca/ca.py
Crtl-a
d

The Crtl-a, d detaches the screen session.

That's it, enjoy!
