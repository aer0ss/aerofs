Middleman
=========

What is it?
-----------

Middleman is a man in the middle https server. We use it to reroute calls to aws in order to install whatever package we want to via the automatic updater.

How do I use it?
----------------

1) Install the aerofs-middleman package.
2) Edit /opt/middleman/middleman.conf and set the target to the url you will be forwarding to
3) copy /opt/middleman/cacert.pem to all clients
4) On each client run (you may have to modify the command to use the correct path to lib/security/cacerts):
    Linux:
        sudo keytool -keystore /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts -importcert -alias maninthemiddle -file cacert.pem
    Windows:
        C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin\keytool -keystore C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\lib\security\cacerts -importcert -alias maninthemiddle -file cacert.pem
    Mac OS X:
        TODO: (AL)
5) service middleman restart
6) Edit necessary hosts files / dns so that requests to s3 get directed to the box running middleman.
7) Laugh in the face of the poor clients who are being lied to.
