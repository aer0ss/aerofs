Dryad
=====
Dryad is the codename for the problem reporting system used by AeroFS. Its only responsibility is to persist the logs posted by the Dryad clients.

In the current implementation, Dryad exposes a REST API. Dryad clients make POST requests to Dryad and Dryad will persist the logs to the local disk.

Installation
------------
Dryad is provided as a Debian package aerofs-dryad.deb. It can be installed on Debian-based system by running `sudo dpkg -i aerofs-dryad.deb`.

Setup
-----
You may simply run `sudo /opt/dryad/aerofs-dryad-setup` to setup Dryad using the default configuration. Should you choose to do this, please skip to the section Default Configuration.

Alternatively, you may also perform the following steps to customize your Dryad installation.

Note: all of the following steps require root privileges.

- `sudo apt-get install nginx openssl upstart`.
- `sudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/certs` and install a certificate for Dryad in this directory.
  * a script to generate and install self-signed cert is available at `/opt/dryad/aerofs-dryad-generate-and-install-cert`
- `sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`
- provide a nginx site configuration for Dryad.
  * a sample site configuration is available at `/opt/dryad/aerofs-custom`.
  * Dryad installs a backend configuration to `/etc/nginx/backends-enabled/`, the site configuration should include the backend configuration.
- `sudo ln -s /lib/init/upstart-job /etc/init.d/dryad`
- create a data directory where Dryad will persist the logs to. Make sure the user `dryad` has full to the directory.
  * edit `/opt/dryad/dryad.properties` and set `dryad.storage.directory` to this directory.
  * Dryad is running on port 4433 for the time being; there is no way to configure this value.
- `sudo service dryad restart`.
- `sudo service nginx restart`.

Default configuration
---------------------
Running `/opt/dryad/aerofs-dryad-setup` will set Dryad up with the default configuration. The default configuration is as follows:
- Dryad's properties file is located at `/opt/dryad/dryad.properties`.
- Dryad's cert and key are installed to `/etc/nginx/certs/`.
- Logs uploaded from the clients will be saved under `/data`.
- Dryad is running on port 4433.
- Nginx runs as a reverse-proxy for Dryad and exposes Dryad on port 443.
- Dryad uses self-signed key good for 10 years.

Test
----
A test script is available at `/opt/dryad/aerofs-dryad-test`. The script makes a REST call to the Dryad server to ensure the server is properly configured.
