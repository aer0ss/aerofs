Prepare VMs:
    1)  Install Ubuntu 12.04
    2)  install openssh-server
    3)  copy public key (in this directory) to VMs /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

Set up Master (will update if already set up):
    ./deploy_vm_master <master ip>

Set up Agent:
    ./deploy_vm_agent <agent ip>

Test puppet script (on the agent):
    puppet agent -t --certname=<node hostname> --server=<master hostname>

NOTE: You must use the actual hostname of the master when calling puppet agent.
      The vm should have an entry in hosts (created during deploy_vm_master)

ALSO: If port knocking (or any other service) gets in your way, just comment it out of site.pp
