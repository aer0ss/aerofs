Steps for setting up a new puppetized server:
    1)  Set the hostname appropriately as per the node configurations in git.
    2)  On the puppet agent, install puppet via apt-get install and run the
        following:

        puppet agent -t --pluginsync

    3)  On the puppet master, run:

        puppetca --sign <hostname>

        Where <hostname> is replaced by the hostname of the puppetized box that
        you are currently setting up.

    4)  Run the puppet agent command again to complete setup.

Note that if you are setting up a CI server, you will need to fix up
/etc/resolv.conf as well.
